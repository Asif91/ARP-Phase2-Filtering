# ARP-Phase2-Filtering

This project is the next phase of ARP project in which we extracted job content from SEEK  portal to analyse the soft skills demand.
In this phase we designed a filtering algorithm to filter soft skills or personality traits and their synonyms researched by different researchers,
and filter them from jobs content extracted from SEEK in phase 1 which was done by other group member .
